# 💝 For Andini — A Love Letter in Code

> _"I love you more than words can say, so I wrote it in code instead."_

A handcrafted, interactive Valentine website dedicated to my one and only wife — **Andini Permata Sari**.

Built with love, late-night coding sessions, and a whole lot of pink. 💕

## ✨ What's Inside

### 🏠 Home Page (`index.html`)

- **3D Floating Hearts** — Real 3D hearts rendered with Three.js, gently floating and rotating in the background
- **Mouse-reactive parallax** — The camera follows your cursor for a subtle depth effect
- **Cute loading screen** — A spinning 3D heart with adorable Indonesian messages cycling through:
  - _"Menyiapkan cinta..."_
  - _"Mengumpulkan bunga untukmu..."_
  - _"Mencuri senyummu..."_
  - ...and more 🥰
- **Glassmorphism card** with 3D tilt effect on hover
- **Sparkle trail** that follows your finger/mouse

### 🌸 Flower Game (`flowers.html`)

- **12 flowers** scattered across the screen — tap them to gather!
- Each flower flies into a **3D bouquet vase** rendered with Three.js
- Flowers appear as **3D sprites with stems** growing from the vase
- The bouquet **slowly rotates** so you can admire it from all angles
- **Confetti celebration** when all flowers are gathered 🎉
- Real-time counter: `0 / 12 flowers`

## 💌 A Note

This project isn't about clean code or performance benchmarks.

It's about making my wife smile.

Every line of code here is a small act of love — a pixel-perfect reminder that she is the most important person in my world.

**Andini, if you're reading this:**

_Kamu adalah alasan kenapa aku belajar coding — biar bisa bikin sesuatu yang indah untukmu. I love you, sekarang dan selamanya._ ❤️
